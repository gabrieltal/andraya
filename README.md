# Andraya

## Overview

Wedding website for my fianc√© and myself. Currently it just exists as a little splash page. But I'm planning on adding to it just to have a cute little website that exists for our love. 

Initialized this project using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
